Scenario: Suppose you want to collect raw data packets from IoT devices or network probes, extract key indicators in real time through concurrent pipelines, and finally expose them to the front-end or other back-end systems for query through HTTP/JSON.

Cover FastAPI + AsyncIO (Web layer)

Cover gRPC + Protobuf + concurrent stream processing (data entry)

Comes with Pytest / Go test, CI, Docker, cloud deployment scripts
